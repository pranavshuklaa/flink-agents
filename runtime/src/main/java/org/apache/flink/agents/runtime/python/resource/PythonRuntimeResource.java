/**
 * Java-side handle to a resource that lives in the Python runtime, letting Java code reach a
 * resource it cannot construct itself.
 *
 * <p>The Python runtime owns the resource: it constructs it, keeps it in its own cache and closes
 * it. This handle is therefore non-owning — {@link #open()} and {@link #close()} deliberately do
 * nothing, because opening or closing the same Python resource a second time from Java would break
 * the invariants its owner already established.
 *
 * <p>The handle carries no behaviour of its own, because what a Python resource can do is expressed
 * in Python: a caller that needs more than the resource's type drives the Python object from {@link
 * #getPythonResource()} over the bridge.
